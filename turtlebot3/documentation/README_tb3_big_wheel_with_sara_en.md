## Setup Manual（Quick Start Guide）
### 1. Environment Setup
Few configurations from TurtleBot3 are required in order to use and test the new Big Wheel model from the TurtleBot3 Friends family. To do so, please follow the official TurtleBot3 e-Manual 「[Quick Start Guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)」. However, take note of the following changes that are pointed out.

- About [1.1. PC Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup)
Big Wheel model uses whether Raspberry Pi 4B or NUC11 as SBC. Right now, it is only supported in ROS Noetic enviroment. Please, select the 「Noetic」 branch from the 「[Quick Start Guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)」.


- Changes in [1.1.4. Install TurtleBot3 Packages](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#install-turtlebot3-packages)

Once ROS Noetic is already installed, we will install some required ROS packages from the ROBOTIS Japan official GitHub site. Please, introduce the following commands in your terminal.

```code
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-dynamixel-sdk
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-turtlebot3-msgs
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-turtlebot3
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
$ git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
$ git clone -b noetic-jp-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/turtlebot3_jp_custom
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- About [3.2. SBC Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/#sbc-setup)

In the new Big Wheel model, NUC11 is used as main processing computer, instead the Raspbery Pi 4B that has being used in `Buger` or `Waffle Pi` models. We will omit the usual SBC setup setup. Please follow the next steps in your NUC.

> **Note**
> In the case you want to still use Raspberry Pi 4B, please follow those steps from the TurtleBot3 e-Manual.

1. Install Ubuntu 20.04.

2. Install ROS Noetic.

3. Install TurtleBot3 required packages as it follows

```code
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-dynamixel-sdk
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-turtlebot3-msgs
$ sudo apt remove ros-noetic-turtlebot3
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
$ git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
$ git clone -b noetic-jp-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/turtlebot3_jp_custom
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- Changes in [3.3. OpenCR Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup)

The setup of the OpenCR is done through the NUC.

1. Connect the [OpenCR](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/) to te NUC through a micro USB cable.

2. Skip the installation of arm Debian packages (in NUC are not required).

3. Select ```big_wheel_noetic``` as the `OPENCR_MODEL`.
```code
$ export OPENCR_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
$ export OPENCR_MODEL=big_wheel_noetic
$ rm -rf ./opencr_update.tar.bz2
```

4. Download the firmware and uncompress it.
```code
$ wget https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/OpenCR_jp_custom/releases/download/v1.0.0/opencr_update_jp_custom.tar.bz2
$ tar -xvf opencr_update_jp_custom.tar.bz2 
```

5. Burn the firmware into the OpenCR.
```code
$ cd ./opencr_update
$ ./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr
```

6. If the firmware for the TurtleBot3 Big Wheel has been successfully burnt into the OpenCR, the following message will appear.
![TB3 Big Wheel OpenCR Success Output](/turtlebot3/documentation/tb3_big_wheel_opencr.png)


### 2. Network Environment
In usual TurtleBot3 models, Raspberri Pi has being used to distribute the main processing to the `master pc` which counts with higher processing performance. In the case of the new Big Wheel model, NUC is set up as the `master pc`. To connect with it, we will use ssh through a remote PC, and visualize the NUC-processed topic in Rviz. Please, follow the next steps.

> **Note**
> In the case you want to use Raspberry Pi 4B, please follow those steps from the TurtleBot3 e-Manual.

- **In the NUC（master PC）**
1. Check the IP address the NUC is connected to.

```code
$ ifconfig
```

Inside the 「wlp2s0」>「inet addr」, you will find an ip similar to `192.168.X.XXX`. Please, ntake a note of it.
> **Note**
> The 「X」 from the ip `192.168.X.XXX` may change depending on your network.
2. Write the ROS IP inside your 「~/.bashrc」 file.

```code ~/.bashrc
$ nano ~/.bashrc
```

Move until the last line of the document and write down the following lines. (Do not forget to change the 「X」 depending on your IP)

```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.X.XXX:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.X.XXX
```

3. Once, it has been already added to the file, press `Ctrl+s` to save and then, `Ctrl+x` to go back.

4. Lastly, apply the changes of ROS IP to take them into effect.

```code
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

- **In the Remote PC**

1. Do not forget the IP address of your NUC. (192.168.X.XXX)
1. Check the IP address of your `remote PC` using the `ifconfig` command and take note of it. (192.168.X.YYY)
1. Write the ROS IP inside your 「~/.bashrc」 file.

```code ~/.bashrc
$ nano ~/.bashrc
```

Move until the last line of the document and write down the following lines. (Do not forget to change the 「X」 and the 「Y」 depending on your IP)。

```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.X.XXX:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.X.YYY
```

4. Once, it has been already added to the file, press `Ctrl+s` to save and then, `Ctrl+x` to go back.

5. Lastly, apply the changes of ROS IP to take them into effect.

```code
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Additional packages setup
In the new TurtleBot3 Big Wheel model, 「Realsense D435」 is used as defaut camera and 「LDS-series」 as default LiDAR sensor. Here, we will explain about its setup.

> **Warning**
> The following steps are conducted in the `remote PC`.

1. **Camera setup**

First of all, please install the requiered packages.
- ROS Wrapper for Intel® RealSense™ Devices (Based on official website)

```code
$ sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-camera
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/realsense-ros_jp_custom
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

> **Note**
> If you want to know more in detail about the [realsense-ros](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros), please refer to the official GitHub repository.

Now, in order to use the Realsense D435 in the Gazebo simulation as well, download the next repository.

```code
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/pal-robotics/realsense_gazebo_plugin
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```


1. **LiDAR setup**

In the case of TurtleBot3 Big Wheel as default, we use the same sensor provided in the original TurtleBot3. You can decide t use whether the LDS-01 or the LDS-02. In that case, please refere to the TurtleBot3 e-Manual to complete the setup


## Simulation Environment（Gazebo）
TurtleBot3 Pizza counts with Gazebo support, a simulation environment which takes into account the physics of its virtual environmet. By just dowloading the following package, you will be able to use it with no problem.

```code
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations_jp_custom
$ git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/lightsfm
$ cd lightsfm
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```
